# Things that still need doing

 - More test coverage.(Took quite some time to get my head around testing react hooks)
 - ESLINTING!! 
 - Add more documentation.
 - Clear technical debt (making sure proptype validation is up to date, managing errors better, cleaner directory structure etc)
 - Add the 'Stretch' features
 - Fix CSS Issues (overflowing elements, naming clashes with library )
